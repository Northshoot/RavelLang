ToResolve:
making variables

TODO's for Ravel:

* add imports
* define controller life cycle
* draw architecture
* move to multiple models and multiple controller using same model per tier
* remove fields from compiler to and make them writen in Ravel
* types get resolved statically from primitive types
* fields are writen as model + controller?
* introducing struct
* introducing array
* option to write custom fields and define newtype
* type is translated, plus types have allowed operations
* automate testing
* rewrite apps
* define new IR
* define platform API
* define controller API
* define security API
* define decoration API
* define expert systems and decorators
* lower down
